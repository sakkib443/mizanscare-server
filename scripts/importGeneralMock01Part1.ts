<h2>Your New Electron Washing Machine</h2>
<p>These introductory notes will outline some basic information regarding your new Electron Washing Machine. Read the notes carefully, as you will avoid some possible problems.</p>

<p>1. Remember, always get your washing machine installed by a qualified installer. This will include all qualified electricians and plumbers. Your retailer will probably be able to recommend someone or provide the service. Don’t use friends or try it yourself and beware of cowboys! Non-qualified installation will lead to the nullification of the guarantee.</p>

<p>2. Your new Electron Washing Machine will work with any good quality washing detergent, but it has been designed to work with some better brands. See the main user’s guide for a list of recommended detergents.</p>

<p>3. It is very possible that the water where you live is hard. Prolonged use with hard water will lead to scale calcification in all washing machines, and no technology can stop this. To avoid this, it is recommended that you install a water softener to the washing machine water supply. Local plumbers will be able to advise you of your area’s water type and what water softener would be suitable if applicable.</p>

<p>4. All new Electron Washing Machines come with a standard 2 year manufacturer’s guarantee. While we are confident that your new Electron Washing Machine has been manufactured to the highest possible quality standards, if you would like to invest in a 5 year guarantee, this can be purchased online on our website, www.electronmachines.com. We believe it’s the best thing to do for peace of mind.</p>

<p>5. Before washing clothes for the first time in your new Electron Washing Machine, it is important that you run the machine one time with no clothes. You can use detergent if you wish, but this is not necessary. Use setting 8 at 40 degrees for best results.</p>

<p>6. Remember, before washing clothes, check all pockets etc. for any coins, tissues or other belongings. Coins and tissues can sometimes get into the machinery and cause your new Electron Washing Machine to break down.</p>

<p>7. Some minor faults with your new Electron Washing Machine can be fixed without having to call in expensive help. To help you with this, we have created a troubleshooting guide on our website, www.electronmachines.com. There are straightforward questions that cover most possible problems and, once diagnosed, the problems can usually be dealt with by yourself without having to call the plumber or electrician.</p>

<p>8. Why not take a little time to register your new Electron Washing Machine with us? It doesn’t take much time, and if we know who you are, we will be able to service you better. Just go to the appropriate icon on our website (www.electronmachines.com) to register. You will be taken to a page where you will be asked for a few details.</p>

<p>9. Finally, we are extremely interested to know what your experience is like with your new Electron Washing Machine.</p>`,
