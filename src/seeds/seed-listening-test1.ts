Importance
• it provides __________ (31) and food for a wide range of species
• its leaves provide __________ (32) which is used to make a disinfectant

Reasons for present decline in number

A) Diseases
(i) 'Mundulla Yellows'
• Cause – lime used for making __________ (33) was absorbed
– trees were unable to take in necessary iron through their roots

(ii) 'Bell-miner Associated Die-back'
• Cause – __________ (34) feed on eucalyptus leaves
– they secrete a substance containing sugar
– bell-miner birds are attracted by this and keep away other species

B) Bushfires
William Jackson's theory:
• high-frequency bushfires have impact on vegetation, resulting in the growth of __________ (35)
• mid-frequency bushfires result in the growth of eucalyptus forests, because they:
– make more __________ (36) available to the trees
– maintain the quality of the __________ (37)
• low-frequency bushfires result in the growth of __________ (38) 'rainforest', which is:
– a __________ (39) ecosystem
– an ideal environment for the __________ (40) of the bell-miner`,
